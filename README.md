### About

I am passionate about data and using it to translate real world high impact problems into rigorous data science based solutions. 
I have over 4 years of experience in data science and analytics at Olacabs (Uber's largest Indian competitor).
I did my master's in Data Science from the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
My work mostly involved predictive modeling, non-linear large scale optimization, creating data pipelines and customer segmentation.
As part of my research assistantship, I also worked on reducing the effects of processing latency via deep learning models in autonomous driving.
